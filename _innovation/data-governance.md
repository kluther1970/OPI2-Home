## Data Governance

The Office of Civic Innovation, in partnership with the Office of Performance Improvement, works to grow the data-driven culture in Louisville Metro. We are responsible for improving the collection, use, process, and storage of our enterprise data systems and training Louisville Metro's staff in best practices in all things data.

### Data Training & Organizational Development

Curriculum, Training, and Presentations for 50+ cross departmental employees that deal with data on topics around the data lifecycle, quality, collection, storage, metadata, visualization, business intelligence, and partner collaboration including data sharing and open data.

### Data Policy

Working groups to define and improve metro data policy, including open data, street addresses, data inventories, data standards, race/nationality, and coordinating with outside agencies.

### Louisville Badges

Employees can earn Badges by doing breakthrough innovation, continuous improvement, and daily work.  There are digital and physical rewards and ways to showcase your accomplishments.â€¯ The goal is to encourage Metro employees across all agencies to learn new skills and to be better equipped to serve our citizens.

## Data Science

We do analysis on all kinds of data for different departments, including traffic data, FCC data, HR, the mayor's office, LouieStat, physical infrastructure, Metro owned assets, budget and finance, and 311 service calls.

## Open Data
