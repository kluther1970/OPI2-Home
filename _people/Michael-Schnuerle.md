bio: "Michael Schnuerle has spent 14 years in civic tech, and 24 years working on internet projects. His first product was an online crime map built using open records requests and Google Maps in 2005, which grew into open data advocacy and building civic services around real-time transportation, public safety, geocoding, data standards, and APIs. As Louisville Metro's first data officer in the Mayor Greg Fischer's Office of Civic Innovation, he works with departments and external partners to share information, foster data-driven decision-making, and promote transparency through open data.  His latest focus is collaboratively building common open source tools with other governments and partners through the Open Government Coalition."
