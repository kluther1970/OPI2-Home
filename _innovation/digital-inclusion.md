## About Digital Inclusion

Today, participation in society relies on the ability to access and use the Internet. Whether applying for a job, doing homework, or starting a business, all of our residents need digital skills, tools, and connectivity to fully participate and engage in modern society. These factors are increasingly becoming the choke points that prevent thousands of our citizens from engaging and accessing the benefits of a knowledge-driven, innovative economy.

To promote digital inclusion in Louisville, Louisville Metro Government and over 10 partnering agencies, including the Louisville Metro Housing Authority, KentuckianaWorks and Louisville Free Public Library, have been working diligently to increase the equity of access to the Internet and technology across the city. In May 2017, we released Louisvilleâ€™s [Digital Inclusion Plan](https://digitalinclusion.louisvilleky.gov), a blueprint for decreasing the digital divide in Louisville.

Our digital inclusion efforts focus on three areas of work: [focus areas](http://digitalinclusion.louisvilleky.gov/our-focus-areas):

* **Connectivity:** increasing home internet access
* **Digital Skills:** teaching the necessary skills to use modern technology
* **Hardware:** bringing computers (laptops and desktops) into homes
